# Germany-ApartmentsRentalOfferAnalysis
Python-based project on trends and factors influencing Total rental offers in Germany

## Objective
A number of analytical approaches would be employed to develop insights into what informs the price of rental apartments in Germany. These insights can help make recommendations that will guide and inform German residents when they search and make Potential apartment choices and investments

## Data
This is open-source [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany)
extracted from [Immoscout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/), the biggest real estate platform in Germany, but was downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonaslneri/german-rent-avg-by-postal-code) for this project. Data contains rental apartments from different German states and their properties
